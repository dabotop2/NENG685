abstract = {This paper provides a method for estimating the probability distributions of the levelized cost s of electricity. Th e se probability distributions can be used to find cost - risk minimizing portfolios of electricity generating assets including Combined - Cycle Gas Turbines ( burning natural gas ) , coal - fired power plants with sulfur scrubbers , and Small Modular Reactors, SMRs . Probability densities are proposed for a dozen electricity generation cost drivers, including fuel prices and externalities costs . Given the long time horizons involved in the planning, construction, operation, refurbishment, and post - retirement management of generating assets , price data from the last half century are used to represent long - run price probabilities. This paper shows that SMRs can competitively replace coal units in a portfolio of coal and natural gas generating stations to reduce the levelized cost risk associated with the vola tility of natural gas prices and unknown carbon costs .

abstract = {Global optimization is concerned with the computation and characterization of global optima of nonlinear functions. During the past three decades the field of global optimization has been growing at a rapid pace, and the number of publications on all aspects of global optimization has been increasing steadily. Many applications, as well as new theoretical, algorithmic, and computational contributions have resulted.The Handbook of Global Optimization is the first comprehensive book to cover recent developments in global optimization. Each contribution in the Handbook is essentially expository in nature, but scholarly in its treatment. The chapters cover optimality conditions, complexity results, concave minimization, DC programming, general quadratic programming, nonlinear complementarity, minimax problems, multiplicative programming, Lipschitz optimization, fractional programming, network problems, trajectory methods, homotopy methods, interval methods, and stochastic approaches.The Handbook of Global Optimization is addressed to researchers in mathematical programming, as well as all scientists who use optimization methods to model and solve problems.},

@article{Sobott2013,
abstract = {The performance of a single-photon-counting hybrid pixel detector has been investigated at the Australian Synchrotron. Results are compared with the body of accepted analytical models previously validated with other detectors. Detector functionals are valuable for empirical calibration. It is shown that the matching of the detector dead-time with the temporal synchrotron source structure leads to substantial improvements in count rate and linearity of response. Standard implementations are linear up to ∼0.36 MHz pixel(-1); the optimized linearity in this configuration has an extended range up to ∼0.71 MHz pixel(-1); these are further correctable with a transfer function to ∼1.77 MHz pixel(-1). This new approach has wide application both in high-accuracy fundamental experiments and in standard crystallographic X-ray fluorescence and other X-ray measurements. The explicit use of data variance (rather than N(1/2) noise) and direct measures of goodness-of-fit ($\chi$(r)(2)) are introduced, raising issues not encountered in previous literature for any detector, and suggesting that these inadequacies of models may apply to most detector types. Specifically, parametrization of models with non-physical values can lead to remarkable agreement for a range of count-rate, pulse-frequency and temporal structure. However, especially when the dead-time is near resonant with the temporal structure, limitations of these classical models become apparent. Further, a lack of agreement at extreme count rates was evident.},

These corrective factors directly depend on the radionuclide decay scheme and on the detector efficiency for the measurement geometrical conditions and can be computed using the Efficiency Transfer for Nuclide Activity (ETNA) software. The accuracy of the corrections depends on the total efficiency (TE) calibration that is hardly obtained over the whole energy as the required experimental conditions are not easily attained. Monte Carlo simulation is used to link the TE calibration to the full-energy peak one. The computation results are compared with experimental data obtained using four high-purity germanium detectors. The influence of TE accuracy on the coincidence-summing corrections is also derived. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We will discuss this strategy with differential evolution and then evaluate their performance by solving real-world optimisation problems such as pressure vessel and speed reducer design. Results suggest that we can reduce the computing effort by a factor of up to ten in many applications. (from publisher's website)},

abstract = {Nuclear Security aims at the prevention and detection of and response to, theft, sabotage, unauthorized access, illegal transfer or other malicious acts involving nuclear material". Nuclear Forensics is a key element of nuclear security. Nuclear Forensics is defined as a methodology that aims at re-establishing the history of nuclear material of unknown origin. It is based on indicators that arise from known relationships between material characteristics and process history. Thus, nuclear forensics analysis includes the characterization of the material and correlation with production history. To this end, we can make use of parameters such as the isotopic composition of the nuclear material and accompanying elements, chemical impurities, macroscopic appearance and microstructure of the material. In the present paper, we discuss the opportunities for attribution of nuclear material offered by nuclear forensics as well as its limitations. Particular attention will be given to the role of nuclear reactions. Such reactions include the radioactive decay of the nuclear material, but also reactions with neutrons. When uranium (of natural composition) is exposed to neutrons, plutonium is$\backslash$n$\backslash$n236$\backslash$n$\backslash$nneutrons. When uranium (of natural composition) is exposed to neutrons, plutonium is formed, as well as 236U. We will illustrate the methodology using the example of a piece of uranium metal that dates back to the German nuclear program in the 1940's. A combination of different analytical techniques and model calculations enables a nuclear forensics interpretation, thus correlating the material characteristics with the production history.},

abstract = {The mathematical modeling of systems often requires the use of both nonlinear and discrete components. Discrete decision variables model dichotomies, discontinuities, and general logical relationships. Nonlinear functions are required to accurately represent physical properties such as pressure, stress, temperature, and equilibrium. Problems involving both discrete variables and nonlinear constraint functions are known as mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs) and are among the most challenging computational optimization problems faced by researchers and practitioners. In this paper, we describe relevant scientific applications that are naturally modeled as MINLPs, we provide an overview of available algorithms and software, and we describe ongoing methodological advances for solving MINLPs. These algorithmic advances are making increasingly larger instances of this important family of problems tractable.},

Hazard models and multinomial logit are used to test theories of nuclear proliferation.

From the neutron spectrum measured with the MRS, many critical implosion parameters are determined including the primary DT neutron yield, the ion temperature, and the down-scattered neutron yield. As the MRS detection efficiency is determined from first principles, the absolute DT neutron yield is obtained without cross-calibration to other techniques. The MRS primary DT neutron measurements at OMEGA and the NIF are shown to be in excellent agreement with previously established yield diagnostics on OMEGA, and with the newly commissioned nuclear activation diagnostics on the NIF.},

Bonabeau has defined the swarm intelligence as “any attempt to design algorithms or distributed problem-solving devi ces inspired by the co llective behaviour of social insect colonies and other animal societies” [1]. Bonabeau et al. focused their viewpoint on social insects alone such as termites, bees , wasps as well as other different ant species. However, the term swarm is used in a general manner to refer to any restrained collection of interacting agents or individua ls. The classical example of a swarm is bees swarming around their hive; nevertheless the metaphor can easily be extended to other systems with a similar architecture. An ant colony can be thought of as a swarm whose individual agents are ants. Similarly a flock of birds is a swarm of birds. An immune system [2] is a swarm of cells and molecules as well as a crowd is a swarm of people [3]. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm models the social behaviour of bird flocking or fish schooling [4]},

Although these corrections are not important for environmental samples (less than 5{\%}), they can be significant in the efficiency calibration with multi-gamma-ray radioisotopes as they have to be measured in the same geometry. In this paper we propose a new method for determining summing corrections which does not require other monoenergetic radioisotopes. Thus, a HPGe-detector-efficiency calibration can be performed with radionuclides emitting gamma rays in cascade, such as 152Eu or 226Ra. The method has been successfully validated.},

The device was a plutonium implosion device similar to the device that destroyed Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9 of that same year. Recently, with the enactment of US public law 111-140, the "Nuclear Forensics and Attribution Act," scientists in the government and academia have been able, in earnest, to consider what type of forensic-style information may be obtained after a nuclear detonation. To conduct a robust attribution process for an exploded device placed by a nonstate actor, forensic analysis must yield information about not only the nuclear material in the device but about other materials that went into its construction. We have performed an investigation of glassed ground debris from the first nuclear test showing correlations among multiple analytical techniques. Surprisingly, there is strong evidence, obtainable only through microanalysis, that secondary materials used in the device can be identified and positively associated with the nuclear material.},

The absolute neutron intensity was accurately determined from the number of 7Be nuclei produced in the 7Li target which is equal to the number of the monoenergetic peak neutrons released in the 4?? direction. The angular distribution function of the peak neutrons is necessary for the estimation of the monoenergetic neutrons emitted in the forward direction for the sample irradiation. The distribution function was measured for proton energies of 20, 30 and 40 MeV and was collected from papers for energies between 25 and 800 MeV to get the universal curve. Activation experiments of various natural and enriched samples were performed at this quasi-monoenergetic neutron field. Here we show the neutron activation cross sections of the 197Au(n, 2n)196Au, 197Au(n, 4n)194Au and 59Co(n, 2n??)54Mn reactions as examples.},

The sampling scheme is also applied to ray tracing, with a significant improvement in error.},

The observed ratio of the concentrations of (198m+g)Au and (196g)Au is a performance signature of ablator areal density and the fuel assembly confinement time. We identify the measurement of nuclear cross sections of astrophysical importance as a potential application of the neutrons generated at the NIF.},

abstract = {In the wake of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident, questions are being raised about the future of the uranium market, including as regards the number of reactors expected to be built in the coming years, the amount of uranium required to meet forward demand, the adequacy of identified uranium resources to meet that demand and the ability of the sector to meet reactor requirements in a challenging investment climate. This 24th edition of the ?Red Book?, a recognised world reference on uranium jointly prepared by the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Atomic Energy Agency, provides analyses and information from 42 producing and consuming countries in order to address these and other questions. It offers a comprehensive review of world uranium supply and demand as well as data on global uranium exploration, resources, production and reactor-related requirements. It also provides substantive new information on established uranium production centres around the world and in countries developing production centres for the first time. Projections of nuclear generating capacity and reactor-related requirements through 2035, incorporating policy changes following the Fukushima accident, are also featured, along with an analysis of long-term uranium supply and demand issues.},

abstract = {Nuclear Security aims at the prevention and detection of and response to, theft, sabotage, unauthorized access, illegal transfer or other malicious acts involving nuclear material". Nuclear Forensics is a key element of nuclear security. Nuclear Forensics is defined as a methodology that aims at re-establishing the history of nuclear material of unknown origin. It is based on indicators that arise from known relationships between material characteristics and process history. Thus, nuclear forensics analysis includes the characterization of the material and correlation with production history. To this end, we can make use of parameters such as the isotopic composition of the nuclear material and accompanying elements, chemical impurities, macroscopic appearance and microstructure of the material. In the present paper, we discuss the opportunities for attribution of nuclear material offered by nuclear forensics as well as its limitations. Particular attention will be given to the role of nuclear reactions. Such reactions include the radioactive decay of the nuclear material, but also reactions with neutrons. When uranium (of natural composition) is exposed to neutrons, plutonium is$\backslash$n$\backslash$n236$\backslash$n$\backslash$nneutrons. When uranium (of natural composition) is exposed to neutrons, plutonium is formed, as well as 236U. We will illustrate the methodology using the example of a piece of uranium metal that dates back to the German nuclear program in the 1940's. A combination of different analytical techniques and model calculations enables a nuclear forensics interpretation, thus correlating the material characteristics with the production history.},

A disadvantage of using categorical variables is the lack of continuous relaxations, which precludes the use of modern integer programming techniques. We show how to express categorical variables with standard integer modeling techniques, and we illustrate this approach on a load-bearing thermal insulation system. The system consists of a number of insulators of different materials and intercepts that minimize the heat flow from a hot surface to a cold surface. Our new model allows us to employ black-box modeling languages and solvers and illustrates the interplay between integer and nonlinear modeling techniques. We present numerical experience that illustrates the advantage of the standard integer model.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}$\backslash$n},

Epithermal neutron beams shaped by three moderator materials, Al/AlF3, 7LiF, and D2O, have been analyzed and their usefulness for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) treatments evaluated. Radiation transport through the moderator assembly has been simulated with the Monte Carlo N-particle code (MCNP). Fluence and dose distributions in a head phantom were calculated using BNCT treatment planning software. Depth-dose distributions and treatment times were studied as a function of proton beam energy and moderator thickness. It was found that an accelerator-based neutron source with Al/AlF3 or 7LiF as moderator material can produce depth-dose distributions superior to those calculated for a previously published neutron beam design for the Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor, achieving up to approximately 50{\%} higher doses near the midline of the brain. For a single beam treatment, a proton beam current of 20 mA, and a 7LiF moderator, the treatment time was estimated to be about 40 min. The tumor dose deposited at a depth of 8 cm was calculated to be about 21 Gy-Eq.},

abstract = {We describe the physics and data included in the Reference Input Parameter Library, which is devoted to input parameters needed in calculations of nuclear reactions and nuclear data evaluations. Advanced modelling codes require substantial numerical input, therefore the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has worked extensively since 1993 on a library of validated nuclear-model input parameters, referred to as the Reference Input Parameter Library (RIPL). A final RIPL coordinated research project (RIPL-3) was brought to a successful conclusion in December 2008, after 15 years of challenging work carried out through three consecutive IAEA projects. The RIPL-3 library was released in January 2009, and is available on the Web through http://www-nds.iaea.org/RIPL-3/. This work and the resulting database are extremely important to theoreticians involved in the development and use of nuclear reaction modelling (ALICE, EMPIRE, GNASH, UNF, TALYS) both for theoretical research and nuclear data evaluations. The numerical data and computer codes included in RIPL-3 are arranged in seven segments: MASSES contains ground-state properties of nuclei for about 9000 nuclei, including three theoretical predictions of masses and the evaluated experimental masses of Audi et al. (2003). DISCRETE LEVELS contains 117 datasets (one for each element) with all known level schemes, electromagnetic and $\gamma$-ray decay probabilities available from ENSDF in October 2007. NEUTRON RESONANCES contains average resonance parameters prepared on the basis of the evaluations performed by Ignatyuk and Mughabghab. OPTICAL MODEL contains 495 sets of phenomenological optical model parameters defined in a wide energy range. When there are insufficient experimental data, the evaluator has to resort to either global parameterizations or microscopic approaches. Radial density distributions to be used as input for microscopic calculations are stored in the MASSES segment. LEVEL DENSITIES contains phenomenological parameterizations based on the modified Fermi gas and superfluid models and microscopic calculations which are based on a realistic microscopic single-particle level scheme. Partial level densities formulae are also recommended. All tabulated total level densities are consistent with both the recommended average neutron resonance parameters and discrete levels. GAMMA contains parameters that quantify giant resonances, experimental gamma-ray strength functions and methods for calculating gamma emission in statistical model codes. The experimental GDR parameters are represented by Lorentzian fits to the photo-absorption cross sections for 102 nuclides ranging from 51V to 239Pu. FISSION includes global prescriptions for fission barriers and nuclear level densities at fission saddle points based on microscopic HFB calculations constrained by experimental fission cross sections. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

abstract = {We describe a new cumulated fission product yield (FPY) evaluation for fission spectrum neutrons on plutonium that updates the ENDF/B-VI evaluation by England and Rider, for the forthcoming ENDF/B-VII.1 database release.11We intend to release the ENDF/B-VII.1 database in December 2011, and all released data are subject to CSEWG approval. It is possible that the released evaluated data will differ from those presented in this paper; the evaluated date presented here can be referred to as ENDF/B-VII.1 beta 0. We focus on FPs that are needed for high accuracy burnup assessments; that is, for inferring the number of fissions in a neutron environment. Los Alamos conducted an experiment in the 1970s in the Bigten fast critical assembly to determine fission product yields as part of the Interlaboratory Reaction Rate (ILRR) collaboration, and this has defined the Laboratory's fission standard to this day. Our evaluation includes use of the LANL-ILRR measurements (not previously available to evaluators) as well as other Laboratory FPY measurements published in the literature, especially the high-accuracy mass spectrometry data from Maeck and others. Because the measurement database for some of the FPs is small - especially for 99Mo - we use a meta-analysis that incorporates insights from other accurately-measured benchmark FP data, using R-value ratio measurements. The meta-analysis supports the FP measurements from the LANL-ILRR experiment. Differences between our new evaluations and ENDF/B-VI are small for some FPs (less than 1-2{\%}-relative for 95Zr, 140Ba, 144Ce), but are larger for 99Mo (4{\%}-relative) and 147Nd (5{\%}-relative, at 1.5 MeV) respectively. We present evidence for an incident neutron energy dependence to the 147Nd fission product yield that accounts for observed differences in the FPY at a few-hundred keV average energy in fast reactors versus measurements made at higher average neutron energies in Los Alamos' fast critical assemblies. Accounting for such FPY neutron energy dependencies is important if one wants to reach a goal of determining the number of fissions to accuracies of 1-2{\%}. An evaluation of the energy-dependence of fission product yields is given for all A values based on systematical trends in the measured data, with a focus on the energy dependence over the fast neutron energy range from 0.2-2 MeV. Based on these trends, we present an evaluation of the FPY data at 0.5 and 2.0 MeV average incident neutron energies. This new set of ENDF/B-VII data will enable users to linearly interpolate between the pooled FPY data at {\~{}}0.5 MeV and our new data at 2 MeV to obtain FPYs at other energies. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {A Linac source of epithermal neutrons for BNCT is proposed in this work. A series of simulations has been carried out using the Monte Carlo code MCNPX for the determination of the final composition and configuration of beam shaping assembly (BSA) to moderate the photoneutron spectrum from the hybrid target that was designed in our previous work. The suggested configuration for BSA included 10 cm iron, 30 cm magnesium fluorine and 10 cm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in a cylindrical geometry. Ni, Pb, Bi and borated polyethylene were chosen as the collimator, reflector, gamma and neutron shield, respectively. Epithermal, thermal and fast neutron fluxes in the suggested design were 8.19E8 n/cm 2 s, 2.14E5 n/cm2 s, and 4.82E7 n/cm2 s, respectively, while other IAEA parameters for BNCT facility design had been satisfied. In the next step, the calculated beam parameters were measured for a SNYDER phantom placed 10 cm from the exit of the beam shaping assembly (BSA). MCNP calculation showed that the advantage depth was 8.2 cm and the maximum therapeutic ratio was 5.05, if boron concentrations in the tumor and normal tissue were assumed to be 65 and 18 ppm, respectively. The maximum dose rate for normal tissue was 37.1 cGy/min. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This study was carried out in a laboratory scale to recover uranium from Uro area phosphate ore in the eastern part of Nuba Mountains in Sudan. Phosphate ore samples were collected, and analyzed for uranium abundance. The results showed that the samples contain a significant concentration of uranium with an average of 310.3 ??g/g, which is 2.6 times higher than the world average of phosphate. The green phosphoric acid obtained from the samples was found to contain uranium in the range of 186-2049 ??g/g, with an average of 603.3 ??g/g, and about 98{\%} of uranium content of the phosphate ore was rendered soluble in the phosphoric acid. An extraction process using 25{\%} tributylphosphate, followed by stripping process using 0.5 M sodium carbonate reported that more than 98{\%} of uranium in the green phosphoric acid exists as uranyl tricarbonate complex, moreover, sodic decomposition using 50{\%} sodium hydroxide showed that about 98{\%} of the uranium was precipitated as sodium diuranate concentrate that is known as the yellow cake (Na

The chemical analysis of the obtained uranium concentrates; yellow cake and uranium trioxide proved their nuclear purity and that they meet the standard commercial specification. The obtained results proved that uranium from Uro phosphate ore was successfully recovered as uranium trioxide with an overall recovery percentage of 93{\%}. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {This research is focused on dead time and the subsequent count loss estimation in radiation detection systems. The dead time is the minimum amount of time required between two events to permit detection of those events individually by a radiation detection system. If events occur during the system dead time, they are lost. Such lost information can be important in many applications including high-precision spectroscopy, positron emission tomography (PET), and the scanning of spent nuclear fuel. Understanding of the behavior of radiation detection systems is important; thus this work included a comprehensive review of dead time and pulse pile-up models and methods. The most common way to estimate detector dead time is by one-parameter approximations known as nonparalyzable and paralyzable models. This research proposes a two parameter model that estimates the detector paralysis factor and the dead time based on a graphical method. To determine the two parameters characteristics of a detection system, this work tested a novel technique to saturate the detector using a decaying source. The modified decaying source method, unlike other methods, does not assume the idealized behavior of detection system in use and calculates the overall dead time of the detection system. The paralysis factor for high purity germanium detection system was estimated approaching 100{\%} and the dead time was on the order of 5-10 $\mu$s which compares well with the literature.},

abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are stochastic search methods that mimic the natural biological evolution and/or the social behavior of species. Such algorithms have been developed to arrive at near-optimum solutions to large-scale optimization problems, for which traditional mathematical techniques may fail. This paper compares the formulation and results of five recent evolutionary-based algorithms: genetic algorithms, memetic algorithms, particle swarm, ant-colony systems, and shuffled frog leaping. A brief description of each algorithm is presented along with a pseudocode to facilitate the implementation and use of such algorithms by researchers and practitioners. Benchmark comparisons among the algorithms are presented for both continuous and discrete optimization problems, in terms of processing time, convergence speed, and quality of the results. Based on this comparative analysis, the performance of EAs is discussed along with some guidelines for determining the best operators for each algorithm. The study presents sophisticated ideas in a simplified form that should be beneficial to both practitioners and researchers involved in solving optimization problems. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

These new data complement the currently available experimental data, which are not well known in the energy range below 1 and above 5 MeV. Organic liquid scintillation detectors (EJ-309s) were used together with a digital data-acquisition system. The EJ-309 detectors show excellent pulse shape discrimination capabilities and this is vital for identifying only neutron pulses and rejecting $\gamma$-ray pulses. The measurement data show the dependence of average fission neutron energy as a function of the inducing neutron energy. The data agree well with previously published measurements and Watt spectra fits for energies up to tens of MeV. At high fission-inducing neutron energies the spectrum deviates from Watt-spectra fits. The increased energy deposited in higher energy neutron-induced fissions does not significantly increase emitted fission neutron energies for up to 10 MeV. A significant decrease in neutron energy around second-chance fission cannot be observed beyond the current measurement uncertainties.},

abstract = {A Bayesian approach is proposed for pulse shape discrimination of photons and neutrons in liquid organic scinitillators. Instead of drawing a decision boundary, each pulse is assigned a photon or neutron confidence probability. This allows for photon and neutron classification on an event-by-event basis. The sum of those confidence probabilities is used to estimate the number of photon and neutron instances in the data. An iterative scheme, similar to an expectation-maximization algorithm for Gaussian mixtures, is used to infer the ratio of photons-to-neutrons in each measurement. Therefore, the probability space adapts to data with varying photon-to-neutron ratios. A time-correlated measurement of Am–Be and separate measurements of 137Cs, 60Co and 232Th photon sources were used to construct libraries of neutrons and photons. These libraries were then used to produce synthetic data sets with varying ratios of photons-to-neutrons. Probability weighted method that we implemented was found to maintain neutron acceptance rate of up to 90{\%} up to photon-to-neutron ratio of 2000, and performed 9{\%} better than the decision boundary approach. Furthermore, the iterative approach appropriately changed the probability space with an increasing number of photons which kept the neutron population estimate from unrealistically increasing.},

abstract = {Nuclei undergoing fission can be described by a multi-dimensional potential-energy surface that guides the nuclear shape evolution--from the ground state, through intermediate saddle points and finally to the configurations of separated fission fragments. Until now, calculations have lacked adequate exploration of the shape parameterization of sufficient dimensionality to yield features in the potential-energy surface (such as multiple minima, valleys, saddle points and ridges) that correspond to characteristic observables of the fission process. Here we calculate and analyse five-dimensional potential-energy landscapes based on a grid of 2,610,885 deformation points. We find that observed fission features--such as the distributions of fission fragment mass and kinetic energy, and the different energy thresholds for symmetric and asymmetric fission--are very closely related to topological features in the calculated five-dimensional energy landscapes.},

The required handling techniques for integer, discrete and continuous variables are described including the techniques needed to handle boundary constraints as well as those needed to simultaneously deal with several non-linear and non-trivial constraint functions. In Part 2 of the article a mechanical engineering design related numerical example, design of a coil spring, is given to illustrate the capabilities and the practical use of the method. It is demonstrated that the described approach is capable of obtaining high quality solutions. The novel method is relatively easy to implement and use, effective, efficient and robust, which makes it as an attractive and widely applicable approach for solving practical engineering design problems.},

abstract = {In this contribution, we consider mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems subject to differential-algebraic constraints. This class of problems arises frequently in process design, and the particular case of integrated process and control system design is considered. Since these problems are frequently non-convex, local optimization techniques usually fail to locate the global solution. Here, we propose a global optimization algorithm, based on extensions of the metaheuristic Tabu Search, in order to solve this challenging class of problems in an efficient and robust way. The ideas of the methodology are explained and, on the basis of two case studies, the performance of the approach is evaluated. The first benchmark problem is a Wastewater Treatment Plant model [Alex, J., Bteau, J. F., Copp, J. B., Hellinga, C., Jeppsson, U., Marsili-Libelli, S., et al. (1999). Benchmark for evaluating control strategies in wastewater treatment plants. In Proceedings of the ECC'99 conference] for nitrogen removal and the second case study is the well-known Tennessee Eastman Process [Downs, J. J., {\&} Vogel, E. F. (1993). A plant-wide industrial process control problem. Computers {\&} Chemical Engineering, 17, 245-255]. Numerical experiments with our new method indicate that we can achieve an improved performance in both cases. Additionally, our method outperforms several other recent competitive solvers for the two challenging case studies considered.},

The main parameters controlling prompt fission neutron evaporation have been identified and the prompt fission neutron spectrum has been analyzed by fitting those parameters to the average neutron multiplicity $\nu$̅ from ENDF-B/VII.0, including the energy-energy correlations in the covariance of $\nu$̅ (E) obtained by fitting to the experimental $\nu$̅ data used in the ENDF-B/VII.0 evaluation. We present our results, discuss relevant tests of this new evaluation, and describe possible further improvements.},

abstract = {The National Ignition Facility (NIF) successfully completed its first inertial confinement fusion (ICF) campaign in 2009. A neutron time-of-flight (nTOF) system was part of the nuclear diagnostics used in this campaign. The nTOF technique has been used for decades on ICF facilities to infer the ion temperature of hot deuterium (D(2)) and deuterium-tritium (DT) plasmas based on the temporal Doppler broadening of the primary neutron peak. Once calibrated for absolute neutron sensitivity, the nTOF detectors can be used to measure the yield with high accuracy. The NIF nTOF system is designed to measure neutron yield and ion temperature over 11 orders of magnitude (from 10(8) to 10(19)), neutron bang time in DT implosions between 10(12) and 10(16), and to infer areal density for DT yields above 10(12). During the 2009 campaign, the three most sensitive neutron time-of-flight detectors were installed and used to measure the primary neutron yield and ion temperature from 25 high-convergence implosions using D(2) fuel. The OMEGA yield calibration of these detectors was successfully transferred to the NIF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Optimization is the key to solving many problems in computational biology. Global optimization methods, which provide a robust methodology, and metaheuristics in particular have proven to be the most efficient methods for many applications. Despite their utility, there is a limited availability of metaheuristic tools.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We present MEIGO, an R and Matlab optimization toolbox (also available in Python via a wrapper of the R version), that implements metaheuristics capable of solving diverse problems arising in systems biology and bioinformatics. The toolbox includes the enhanced scatter search method (eSS) for continuous nonlinear programming (cNLP) and mixed-integer programming (MINLP) problems, and variable neighborhood search (VNS) for Integer Programming (IP) problems. Additionally, the R version includes BayesFit for parameter estimation by Bayesian inference. The eSS and VNS methods can be run on a single-thread or in parallel using a cooperative strategy. The code is supplied under GPLv3 and is available at http://www.iim.csic.es/{\~{}}gingproc/meigo.html. Documentation and examples are included. The R package has been submitted to BioConductor. We evaluate MEIGO against optimization benchmarks, and illustrate its applicability to a series of case studies in bioinformatics and systems biology where it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: MEIGO provides a free, open-source platform for optimization that can be applied to multiple domains of systems biology and bioinformatics. It includes efficient state of the art metaheuristics, and its open and modular structure allows the addition of further methods.},

A key step on the way to ignition is to have the energy generated through fusion reactions in an inertially confined fusion plasma exceed the amount of energy deposited into the deuterium-tritium fusion fuel and hotspot during the implosion process, resulting in a fuel gain greater than unity. Here we report the achievement of fusion fuel gains exceeding unity on the US National Ignition Facility using a 'high-foot' implosion method, which is a manipulation of the laser pulse shape in a way that reduces instability in the implosion. These experiments show an order-of-magnitude improvement in yield performance over past deuterium-tritium implosion experiments. We also see a significant contribution to the yield from $\alpha$-particle self-heating and evidence for the 'bootstrapping' required to accelerate the deuterium-tritium fusion burn to eventually 'run away' and ignite.},

abstract = {We consider a Levy flyer of order alpha that starts from a point x0 on an interval [O,L] with absorbing boundaries. We find a closed-form expression for the average number of flights the flyer takes and the total length of the flights it travels before it is absorbed. These two quantities are equivalent to the mean first passage times for Levy flights and Levy walks, respectively. Using fractional differential equations with a Riesz kernel, we find exact analytical expressions for both quantities in the continuous limit. We show that numerical solutions for the discrete Levy processes converge to the continuous approximations in all cases except the case of alpha approaching 2 and the cases of x0 near absorbing boundaries. For alpha larger than 2 when the second moment of the flight length distribution exists, our result is replaced by known results of classical diffusion. We show that if x0 is placed in the vicinity of absorbing boundaries, the average total length has a minimum at alpha=1, corresponding to the Cauchy distribution. We discuss the relevance of this result to the problem of foraging, which has received recent attention in the statistical physics literature.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a surrogate model based algorithm for computationally expensive mixed-integer black-box global optimization problems with both binary and non-binary integer variables that may have computationally expensive constraints. The goal is to find accurate solutions with relatively few function evaluations. A radial basis function surrogate model (response surface) is used to select candidates for integer and continuous decision variable points at which the computationally expensive objective and constraint functions are to be evaluated. In every iteration multiple new points are selected based on different methods, and the function evaluations are done in parallel. The algorithm converges to the global optimum almost surely. The performance of this new algorithm, SO-MI, is compared to a branch and bound algorithm for nonlinear problems, a genetic algorithm, and the NOMAD (Nonsmooth Optimization by Mesh Adaptive Direct Search) algorithm for mixed-integer problems on 16 test problems from the literature (constrained, unconstrained, unimodal and multimodal problems), as well as on two application problems arising from structural optimization, and three application problems from optimal reliability design. The numerical experiments show that SO-MI reaches significantly better results than the other algorithms when the number of function evaluations is very restricted (200-300 evaluations). {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Multiplicative regression model or accelerated failure time model, which becomes linear regression model after logarithmic transformation, is useful in analyzing data with positive responses, such as stock prices or life times, that are particularly common in economic/financial or biomedical studies. Least squares or least absolute deviation are among the most widely used criterions in statistical estimation for linear regression model. However, in many practical applications, especially in treating, for example, stock price data, the size of relative error, rather than that of error itself, is the central concern of the practitioners. This paper offers an alternative to the traditional estimation methods by considering minimizing the least absolute relative errors for multiplicative regression models. We prove consistency and asymptotic normality and provide an inference approach via random weighting. We also specify the error distribution, with which the proposed least absolute relative errors estimation is efficient. Supportive evidence is shown in simulation studies. Application is illustrated in an analysis of stock returns in Hong Kong Stock Exchange.},

The current analysis is based on the recent accomplishment of specific foil activation measurements and on the use of the unfolding code STAY'SL in conjunction with IRDF-90 and IRDF-2002 dosimetry libraries. Specific developments have been conducted to consider the uncertainties associated with the determination of the experimental absolute reaction rates and the initial calculated spectrum in the most realistic manner. In this context, the iterative adjustment process for the neutron spectrum is established on the basis of variance/covariance matrices defined for the three types of input parameters, i.e., the experimental reaction rates, the initial spectrum, and the dosimetry nuclear data files. The results highlight the spectral variations between different locations of the MUSE4 cores, in particular the characteristic behavior of a subcritical configuration driven by an external T(d, n)He 4 (14 MeV neutrons) source.

Level schemes from both radioactive decay and reaction studies are presented, along with associated tables of experimental data and adopted properties for levels and $\gamma$ rays. These include data from several recent high-precision measurements of intensities for $\gamma$ rays emitted in 169Yb $\epsilon$ decay; these are of special interest because of their use as calibration standards. Excited-state information is newly available for Re, Os, Ir and Pt, and heavy-ion reaction studies have significantly expanded our knowledge of excited states in Lu through Ta. More extensive work on $\epsilon$ decay from W is needed and new experimental work will be required to resolve a discrepancy between the J$\pi$ values deduced for a 180-keV level in 169Ta based on extensive band structure from (HI,xn$\gamma$) work (J$\pi$ = 1/2-) and TDPAD measurements (J = 5/2).

@article{Nacht1975,
abstract = {The article focuses on the policy of deterrence that has to be adopted in order to discourage the Soviet Union from stock piling nuclear weapons. Because of its crucial role in the Western strategy of defense, one should like to examine the stability of the thermonuclear balance, which, it is generally supposed, would make aggression irrational or even insane. The notion that a carefully planned surprise attack can be checkmated almost effortlessly, that, in short, one may resume our deep pre-sputnik sleep, is wrong and its nearly universal acceptance is terribly dangerous. Though deterrence is not enough in itself, it is vital. There are two principal points. First, deterring general war in both the early and late 1960's will be hard. Second, even if one can deter general war by a strenuous and continuing effort, this will by no means be the whole of a military, much less a foreign policy. Such a policy would not of itself remove the danger of accidental outbreak or limit the damage in case deterrence failed; nor would it be at all adequate for crises on the periphery. A generally useful way of concluding a grim argument of this kind would be to affirm that one has the resources, intelligence and courage to make the correct decisions.},

abstract = {A novel algorithm for the digital discrimination of neutrons and gamma-rays in a mixed radiation field is presented. Most of the pulse shape discrimination methods in scintillation detection systems use time-domain features of the signal (e.g. charge comparison method or constant-time discrimination). However, there are no frequency-domain discrimination methods up to date in the literature. Our method employs the wavelet transform to extract frequency-domain features for discrimination. Compared to the pulse gradient analysis (PGA) algorithm, it provides an improvement in reducing the overlap area between neutron and gamma events and also in increasing the Figure of Merit (FoM). Another advantage of this method consists in the removal of the dependency of the discrimination method on timing features. Since the light output in the scintillation process is very noisy, this kind of dependency may degrade the performance of the algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Capoulat2014a,
abstract = {The 9Be(d,n)10B reaction was studied as an epithermal neutron source for brain tumor treatment through Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT). In BNCT, neutrons are classified according to their energies as thermal ({\textless}0.5eV), epithermal (from 0.5eV to 10keV) or fast ({\textgreater}10keV). For deep-seated tumors epithermal neutrons are needed. Since a fraction of the neutrons produced by this reaction are quite fast (up to 5-6MeV, even for low-bombarding energies), an efficient beam shaping design is required. This task was carried out (1) by selecting the combinations of bombarding energy and target thickness that minimize the highest-energy neutron production; and (2) by the appropriate choice of the Beam Shaping Assembly (BSA) geometry, for each of the combinations found in (1). The BSA geometry was determined as the configuration that maximized the dose deliverable to the tumor in a 1h treatment, within the constraints imposed by the healthy tissue dose adopted tolerance. Doses were calculated through the MCNP code.The highest dose deliverable to the tumor was found for an 8$\mu$m target and a deuteron beamof1.45MeV. Tumor weighted doses ≥40Gy can be delivered up to about 5cm in depth, withamaximum value of 51Gy at a depth of about 2cm. This dose performance can be improved byrelaxing the treatment time constraint and splitting the treatment into two 1-h sessions. Thesegood treatment capabilities strengthen the prospects for a potential use of this reaction in BNCT. {\textcopyright} 2013 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica.},

The energy dependences of the cumulative yields of Br87, Br88, Br89, Br91, Kr93, Rb94, Rb95, I137, I138, I139, and I140 have been obtained by delayed neutron measurements. The most probable charge ZP(A)in the appropriate isobaric $\beta$-decay chains was estimated. The results were analyzed in terms of the deviation $\Delta$ZP(A′) of the most probable charge of isobaric $\beta$-decay chains from the unchanged charge distribution before prompt neutron emission (nuclear charge polarization) and they are compared with experimental data of other authors and with predictions from Nethaway's ZP-formula and Wahl's ZP-model. We show that the nuclear charge polarization of primary fission fragments ⟨$\Delta$ZP(A′)⟩ before prompt neutron evaporation decreases as the excitation energy of the compound nucleus increases. This decrease is more pronounced for fission of U235. The energy dependencies of $\Delta$ZP(A′) and $\Delta$ZP(ZP) obtained in the present work show an attenuation of the odd-even effects in the charge distribution as the excitation energy of the compound nucleus increases.},

The technique is based on the measurement of ??-rays from the neutron-induced activity in a series of different metal disks followed by spectrum unfolding procedures. In this study, we measure for the first time with this technique a prompt fission neutron spectrum. Special attention is paid to the unfolding procedures and the estimation of the lowest measurable neutron fluence rate, as well as the estimation of sources of the uncertainties.},

abstract = {A review of methods currently used to unfold particle spectra from measured pulse height distributions or other detector readings is given. It is pointed out that most of the measurements in particle spectrometry reveal ill-conditioned or ill-posed problems. The presentation which is given here for examples of such inverse problems is focussed on the algorithms used in the HEPRO unfolding program package of PTB. The question of uncertainty propagation is discussed for least-squares algorithms as well as for those based on maximum entropy. A first attempt has been made to quantify generally the "ambiguity" in ill-posed unfolding problems. The maximum entropy algorithm realized in the MIEKE code allows a clear distinction to be made between two parts of uncertainty, one part coming from ambiguity and one part coming from the usual uncertainty propagation. The resulting uncertainty matrix of the MIEKE code provides these two parts. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

In spite of this attention, there has as yet been no standard definition representing exactly what is involved in modern implementations of the technique. A standard is defined here which is designed to be a straightforward extension of the original algorithm while taking into account more recent developments that can be expected to improve performance on standard measures. This standard algorithm is intended for use both as a baseline for performance testing of improvements to the technique, as well as to represent PSO to the wider optimization community},

abstract = {Reduced chi-squared is a very popular method for model assessment, model comparison, convergence diagnostic, and error estimation in astronomy. In this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can only be estimated for linear models. Concerning nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for differentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation procedure. The impact of noise on the value of reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in particular for small data sets, which are very common in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced chi-squared can only be used with due caution for linear models, whereas it must not be used for nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also applicable to nonlinear models.},

In addition, research in multiobjective and multidisciplinary design optimization has focused on developing a robust and efficient optimization method so it can produce a set of high quality solutions with less computational time. In this paper, two optimization techniques are considered; the first optimization method uses multifidelity hierarchical Pareto-optimality. The second optimization method uses the combination of game strategies Nash-equilibrium and Pareto-optimality. This paper shows how game strategies can be coupled to multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and robust design techniques to produce a set of high quality solutions. Numerical results obtained from both optimization methods are compared in terms of computational expense and model quality. The benefits of using Hybrid and non-Hybrid-Game strategies are demonstrated.},

abstract = {A "proliferator" seeks to complete a first small batch of fission weapons as quickly as possible, whereas an "interdictor" wishes to delay that completion for as long as possible. We develop and solve a max-min model that identifies resource-limited interdiction actions that maximally delay completion time of the proliferator's weapons project, given that the proliferator will observe any such actions and adjust his plans to minimize that time. The model incorporates a detailed project-management (critical path method) submodel, and standard optimization software solves the model in a few minutes on a personal computer. We exploit off-the-shelf project-management software to manage a database, control the optimization, and display results. Using a range of levels for interdiction effort, we analyze a published case study that models three alternate uranium-enrichment technologies. The task of "cascade loading" appears in all technologies and turns out to be an inherent fragility for the proliferator at all levels of interdiction effort. Such insights enable policy makers to quantify the effects of interdiction options at their disposal, be they diplomatic, economic, or military. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

The detector is capable of observing very low neutron fluxes in the presence of ambient gamma background and does not require scintillator pulse-shape discrimination. The spectrometer was characterized for its energy response in fast neutron fields of 2.5 MeV and 14 MeV, and the results are compared with Monte Carlo simulations. Measurements of the fast neutron flux and energy response at 120 m above sea-level (39.130°N, 77.218°W) and at a depth of 560 m in a limestone mine are presented. Finally, the design of a spectrometer with improved sensitivity and energy resolution is discussed.},

@article{Hou2016,
abstract = {Breed-and-burn (B{\&}B) reactors are a special class of fast reactors that are designed to utilize low grade fuel such as depleted uranium without fuel reprocessing. One of the most challenging practical design feasibility issues faced by B{\&}B reactors is the high level of radiation damage their fuel cladding has to withstand in order to sustain the B{\&}B mode of operation - more than twice the maximum radiation damage cladding materials were exposed to so far in fast reactors. This study explores the possibility of reducing the minimum required peak radiation damage by employment of 3-dimensional (3D) fuel shuffling that enables a significant reduction in the peak-to-average axial burnup, that is, more uniform fuel utilization. A new conceptual design of a B{\&}B core made of axially segmented fuel assemblies was adopted to facilitate the 3D shuffling. Also developed is a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm to automate the search for the optimal 3D shuffling pattern (SP). The primary objective of the SA optimization is to minimize the peak radiation damage while its secondary objective is to minimize the burnup reactivity swing, radial power peaking factor and maximum change of fuel assembly power over the cycle. Also studied is the sensitivity of the 3D shuffled core performance to the number of axially stacked sub-assemblies, core height and power level. It was found that compared with the optimal 2-dimensional (2D) shuffled core, the optimal 3D shuffled B{\&}B core made of four 70 cm long axially stacked sub-assemblies and 12 radial shuffling batches offers a 1/3 reduction of the peak radiation damage level - from 534 down to 351 displacements per atom (dpa), along with a 45{\%} increase in the average fuel discharge burnup, and hence, the depleted uranium utilization, while satisfying all major neutronics and thermal-hydraulics design constraints. For the same peak dpa level, the 3D shuffling offers more than double the uranium utilization and the cycle length relative to 2D shuffling. The minimum peak radiation damage is increased to 360 or to 403 dpa if the core is made of, respectively, three - 70 cm or two - 140 cm long axially stacked subassemblies. Reducing the length of the subassemblies of B{\&}B cores made of three-segment assemblies from 70 cm to 60 or 50 cm results in an increase in the peak radiation damage from 360 dpa to, respectively, 368 and 397 dpa.},

Successful attribution of a detonated nuclear weapon, which includes locating the source of the radiological materials used in the weapon, allows for timely responsive measures that prove essential in the period following a nuclear event. In conjunction with intelligence and law enforcement evidence, the technical nuclear forensics (TNF) post-detonation community supports this mission through the development and advancement of expertise to characterize weapon debris through a rapid, accurate, and detailed approach. Though the TNF field is young, numerous strides have been made in recent years toward a more robust characterization capability. This work presents modern advancements in post-detonation expertise over the last ten years and demonstrates the need for continued extensive research in this field.},

The nonrecursive solutions for the fractions of the two TRU radionuclides in the transmuter core before and after the irradiation in the i'th cycle have been obtained by the similarity transformation. With the nonrecursive analytical solutions, the TRU reduction ratio has been formulated as a performance measure for the system. The stability of the system has been defined in terms of the moduli of the eigenvalues of the system. The conditions for a stable system and for a system to reach a quasi-steady state with fewer cycles have been shown in terms of the system parameters. A large value of the non-dimensionalized destruction coefficient d is beneficial for effective waste reduction because (a) the system reaches a quasi-steady state faster; (b) the TRU mass in the waste can be reduced more effectively; and (c) the precursor effect becomes negligible, and each radionuclide can be approximately treated as a single radionuclide without precursors.},

The problem is transformed into with no equality constraints after mixed variables are partitioned and reduced variables for optimization are identified through analyzing and tearing equality constraints. The transformation is implicitly implemented in the PSO algorithm. In addition, for mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problems, discrete variables in the proposed algorithm are updated independently according to a given criterion instead of updating continuous and discrete variables simultaneously. Thus, the proposed algorithm is able to solve the non-convex MINLP problems. Several NLP/MINLP problems including three process synthesis problems are performed. For the test problems, the proposed algorithm demonstrates its advantages in applicability and efficiency for solving non-convex NLP/MINLP problems with equality and/or inequality constraints. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Discrimination afforded by the PGA method is observed to be consistent with that achieved by digital TOF. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Thick target yields of the neutron producing reactions d + Be and p + Be were investigated for deuteron energies between 9.4 and 13.6 MeV and proton energies between 17.2 and 22.0 MeV. The spectral neutron yield per unit beam charge on the Be target was determined by using time-of-flight techniques and the (n, ??) discrimination properties of an NE213 scintillation detector. In addition, the angular dependence of the spectral neutron yield was measured between 0?? and 150?? for a deuteron energy of 13.54 MeV and a proton energy of 19.08 MeV. The spectral neutron yield at 0?? as a function of the incident particle energy, which is approximated by a simple function obtained from a least-squares fit, is compared with previous data. Fluence-averaged mean neutron energies of the neutron spectra are given as a function of the charged particle energy and neutron emission angle for various neutron energy thresholds. The present neutron spectra differ in the low-energy portion from those published by other authors. Deviations of up to 20{\%} are found in the total neutron yield per unit beam charge at 0??. ?? 1989.},

abstract = {Meta-heuristic algorithms are often nature-inspired, and they are becoming very powerful in solving global optimisation problems. More than a dozen major meta-heuristic algorithms have been developed over the last three decades, and there exist even more variants and hybrids of meta-heuristics. This paper intends to provide an overview of nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithms, from a brief history to their applications. We try to analyse the main components of these algorithms and how and why they work. Then, we intend to provide a unified view of meta-heuristics by proposing a generalised evolutionary walk algorithm (GEWA). Finally, we discuss some of the important open questions.},

From this study, the optimal configuration resulted in tumor doses ≥40Gy-Eq, with a maximum value of 51Gy-Eq at a depth of about 2.7cm, in a 60min treatment.The optimal configuration was considered for the treatment planning assessment of a real Glioblastoma Multiforme case.

abstract = {An accurate model of the nonlinear detector response of organic scintillators to neutrons is required to correctly simulate fast neutron detection, as well as interpret measured pulse height data. Several empirical and semi-empirical models are available to fit measured scintillator light output data. In this work, EJ-309 light output data from neutrons depositing 1.15???5.15 MeV on hydrogen were analyzed using empirical models as well as semi-empirical models based on the work of Birks and Voltz. Although all tested models fit the experimental light output data well in the measured range, the models were observed to diverge in low-energy extrapolation. The models were then tested by comparing a measurement and MCNPX-PoliMi simulation of an EJ-309 detector response to fast neutrons from a 252Cf spontaneous fission source. The agreement between the measured and simulated pulse height distributions varied significantly depending on the light output model used. The best agreement between simulated and measured neutron pulse height distributions was achieved by using the Birks model. The bin-by-bin agreement was better than 5{\%} over the range 0.08???2.18 MeVee, and better than 10{\%} from 2.18 to 3.13 MeVee. The integral count rate over the range 0.08???3.14 MeVee differed by less than 1{\%} in absolute units.},

The performance of the CS algorithm is further compared with various algorithms representative of the state of the art in the area. The optimal solutions obtained by CS are mostly far better than the best solutions obtained by the existing methods. The unique search features used in CS and the implications for future research are finally discussed in detail.},

First, the parameter estimation problems emerging from different areas of systems biology are described from the point of view of machine learning. Brief descriptions of various meta-heuristics developed for these problems follow, along with outlines of their advantages and disadvantages. Several important issues in applying meta-heuristics to the systems biology modelling problem are addressed, including the reliability and identifiability of model parameters, optimal design of experiments, and so on.

No excited state data are yet available for 151Cs, 151Ba and 151La; only the isotopic identification has been reported, without information about their half-lives or decay modes. The 151Hf nuclide has not yet been identified. The radioactive decays of 151Ce, 151Ho (35.2-s and 47.2-s activities), 151Er (23.5-s and 0.58-s activities), 151Yb (two activities of about the same half-life) are not well established. For the decay of 151Lu, only the half-life is known. Superdeformed structures are well established in 151Dy and 151Tb with a total of five SD bands in 151Dy and ten SD bands in 151Tb. In 151Gd, six SD bands have been tentatively assigned. In 151Tb, yrast SD-1 band has now (2008Ro23) been linked to normal-deformed structures through two well-defined high-energy ?? transitions and possibly four other tentative ?? rays. This evaluation represents a revision of earlier (1997Si03,1988Si15,1976Ha35) evaluations of A = 151. ?? 2008.},

abstract = {Two 2″×2″ liquid scintillator detectors BC537 and BC501A have been characterized for their responses and efficiencies to $\gamma$-ray detection. Light output resolution and response functions were derived by least-squares minimization of a simulated response function, fitted to experimental data. The $\gamma$-ray response matrix and detection efficiency were simulated with Monte Carlo (MC) methods and validated. For photon energies below 2.4 MeVee, the resolution, as well as the efficiency, of BC501A is better than BC537 scintillator. The situation is reversed when the energy is higher than 2.4 MeVee. BC537 has higher $\gamma$-ray detection efficiency than BC501A if the impinging photon energy is more than 2 MeV due to different ratios of C to H/D atoms.},

abstract = {In nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, two key compo- nents are local intensification and global diversification, and their inter- action can significantly affect the efficiency of a metaheuristic algorithm. However, there is no rule for how to balance these important components. In this paper, we provide a first attempt to give some theoretical basis for the optimal balance of exploitation and exploration for 2D multimodal objective functions. Then, we use it for choosing algorithm-dependent parameters. Finally, we use the recently developed eagle strategy and cuckoo search to solve two benchmarks so as to confirm if the optimal balance can be achieved in higher dimensions. For multimodal problems, computational effort should focus on the global explorative search, rather than intensive local search. We also briefly discuss the implications for further research.},

By investigating these different problem features separately, it is possible to predict the kind of problems to which a certain technique is or is not well suited. However, in contrast to what was suspected beforehand, the experimental results indicate a hierarchy of the algorithms under consideration. Furthermore, the emerging effects are evidence that the suggested test functions provide sufficient complexity to compare multiobjective optimizers. Finally, elitism is shown to be an important factor for improving evolutionary multiobjective search.},

However, special evaluations, such as "Database of prompt gamma rays from slow neutron-capture from elemental analysis" (2007ChZX), have provided additional precise data for levels in 239U. Also, new Coulomb excitation measurements in 239Pu have extended the knowledge of the 1/2[631] rotational band up to J$\pi$=(55/2+), and that of the octupole vibrational band up to J$\pi$=(53/2-).For historical knowledge it is worth mentioning the report on the "Discovery of isotopes of the transuranium elements with 93 {\textless}= Z {\textless}= 98" (2013Fr02), where the information for elements Np, Pu, Am, and Cf with mass number A=239 is presented.The alpha hindrance factors (HF) presented in this evaluation were calculated using values of the radius parameter (r0) interpolated from those for even-even adjacent nuclei given by 1998Ak04.},

The framework is based on a three-tier hierarchy of a problem, an evolutionary algorithm (EA), and a tuner. Furthermore, we distinguish problem instances, parameters, and EA performance measures as major factors, and discuss how tuning can be directed to algorithm performance and/or robustness. For the survey part we establish different taxonomies to categorize tuning methods and review existing work. Finally, we elaborate on how tuning can improve methodology by facilitating well-funded experimental comparisons and algorithm analysis. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

There are several variants of this problem; the most basic problem is the one-dimensional bin packing problem (1-BPP). In this paper, we present a new approach based on the quantum inspired cuckoo search algorithm to deal with the 1-BPP problem. The contribution consists in defining an appropriate quantum representation based on qubit representation to represent bin packing solutions. The second contribution is proposition of a new hybrid quantum measure operation which uses first fit heuristic to pack no filled objects by the standard measure operation. The obtained results are very encouraging and show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Physiologically relevant sources of absorptive intestinal epithelial cells are crucial for human drug transport studies. Human adenocarcinoma-derived intestinal cell lines, such as Caco-2, offer conveniences of easy culture maintenance and scalability, but do not fully recapitulate in vivo intestinal phenotypes. Additional sources of renewable physiologically relevant human intestinal cells would provide a much needed tool for drug discovery and intestinal physiology. We compared two alternative sources of human intestinal cells, commercially available primary human intestinal epithelial cells (hInEpCs) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived intestinal cells to Caco-2, for use in in vitro transwell monolayer intestinal transport assays. To achieve this for iPSC-derived cells, intestinal organogenesis was adapted to transwell differentiation. Intestinal cells were assessed by marker expression through immunocytochemical and mRNA expression analyses, monolayer integrity through Transepithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER) measurements and molecule permeability, and functionality by taking advantage the well-characterized intestinal transport mechanisms. In most cases, marker expression for primary hInEpCs and iPSC-derived cells appeared to be as good as or better than Caco-2. Furthermore, transwell monolayers exhibited high TEER with low permeability. Primary hInEpCs showed molecule efflux indicative of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) transport. Primary hInEpCs and iPSC-derived cells also showed neonatal Fc receptor-dependent binding of immunoglobulin G variants. Primary hInEpCs and iPSC-derived intestinal cells exhibit expected marker expression and demonstrate basic functional monolayer formation, similar to or better than Caco-2. These cells could offer an alternative source of human intestinal cells for understanding normal intestinal epithelial physiology and drug transport.},

It brings together experts from across the international nuclear reaction data community to identify and document discrepancies among existing evaluated data libraries, measured data, and model calculation interpretations, and aims to make progress in reconciling these discrepancies to create more accurate ENDF-formatted files. The focus will initially be on a small number of the highest-priority isotopes, namely 1H, 16O, 56Fe, 235,238U, and 239Pu. This paper identifies discrepancies between various evaluations of the highest priority isotopes, and was commissioned by the OECD's Nuclear Energy Agency WPEC (Working Party on International Nuclear Data Evaluation Co-operation) during a meeting held in May 2012. The evaluated data for these materials in the existing nuclear data libraries — ENDF/B-VII.1, JEFF-3.1, JENDL-4.0, CENDL-3.1, ROSFOND, IRDFF 1.0 — are reviewed, discrepancies are identified, and some integral properties are given.

The main difficulty of this evaluation came from discrepant data for the same three nuclides. For 140La one of the datasets presented many unresolved multiplet levels which were discrepant with the other dataset, and were partially resolved here by the evaluator. For 140Nd the new dataset and the older ones had discrepant $\gamma$ energies which were recalibrated by the evaluator. The two new high-spin dataset of 140Eu had discrepant J$\pi$ assignments for many levels, which were resolved based on a more recent paper which had accurately established the low J$\pi$ values. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

A 7.44 MeV deuteron beam was used on an 27Al target generating a continuous spectrum over the energy range from a few hundred keV to over 10 MeV. The light output response functions are determined using an exponential fit. Detector resolution functions are obtained for the 12.7-by-12.7 and 7.6-by-7.6 cm detectors. It is demonstrated that the dependence on detector size is important for the light output response functions, but not to the same extent for the resolution function, even when photomultiplier tubes, detector material, and other detector characteristics are carefully matched. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Generally, when simulations are time consuming, a surrogate model replaces the computer code in further studies. The very first step for successful surrogate modeling and statistical analysis is the planning of the input configuration that will be used to exercise the simulation code. Among strategies coined for computer experiments, Latin hypercube designs have become particularly popular. This paper provides a short overview of the research in Latin hypercube design of experiments, highlighting potential reasons of its widespread use. The discussion starts with the early developments in optimization of the point selection and goes all the way to the pitfalls of always using Latin hypercube designs for selecting experimental designs. Then, final thoughts are given on how the Latin hypercube design fits in the state of the art as well as opportunities for future research.},

abstract = {Measuring neutrons in the presence of high gamma-ray fluence is a challenge with multi-particle detectors. Organic liquid scintillators such as the EJ-309 are capable of accurate pulse-shape discrimination (PSD) but the chance for particle misclassification is not negligible for some applications. By varying the distance from an EJ-309 scintillator to a strong-gamma-ray source and keeping a weak-neutron source at a fixed position, various gamma-to-neutron ratios can be measured and PSD performance can be quantified. Comparing neutron pulse-height distributions allows for pulse-height specific PSD evaluation, and quantification and visualization of deviation from 252Cf alone. Even with the addition of the misclassified gamma-rays, the PSD is effective in separating particles so that neutron count rate can be predicted with less than 10{\%} error up to a gamma-to-neutron ratio of almost 650. For applications which can afford a reduction in neutron detection efficiency, PSD can be sufficiently effective in discriminating particles to measure a weak neutron source in a high gamma-ray background.},

abstract = {We report on the development of a fast neutron detector using a liquid scintillator doped with enriched Li-6. The lithium was introduced in the form of an aqueous LiCl micro-emulsion with a di-isopropylnaphthalene-based liquid scintillator. A Li-6 concentration of 0.15 {\%} by weight was obtained. A 125 mL glass cell was filled with the scintillator and irradiated with fission-source neutrons. Fast neutrons may produce recoil protons in the scintillator, and those neutrons that thermalize within the detector volume can be captured on the Li-6. The energy of the neutron may be determined by the light output from recoiling protons, and the capture of the delayed thermal neutron reduces background events. In this paper, we discuss the development of this 6Li-loaded liquid scintillator, demonstrate the operation of it in a detector, and compare its efficiency and capture lifetime with Monte Carlo simulations. Data from a boron-loaded plastic scintillator were acquired for comparison. We also present a pulse-shape discrimination method for differentiating between electronic and nuclear recoil events based on the Matusita distance between a normalized observed waveform and nuclear and electronic recoil template waveforms. The details of the measurements are discussed along with specifics of the data analysis and its comparison with the Monte Carlo simulation.},

Combining the recoil proton spectrum and response matrix, the unfolding of neutron spectra was performed by GRAVEL iterative algorithm. A MatLab program based on the GRAVEL method was developed. The continuous neutron spectrum of Am-Be source and monoenergetic neutron spectrum of D-T source have been unfolded successfully and are in good agreement with their standard reference spectra. The unfolded Am-Be spectrum are more accurate than the spectra unfolded by artificial neural networks in recent years.},

@article{Whitley1984,
abstract = {There are two sets of principles involved in the development of the gas centrifuge, the internal separation physics and the external means of spinning a rotor at very high speeds. Only the first aspect is discussed in this part of the review. First, the industrial requirement for the separation of the uranium isotopes is defined so that the separation history can be put in a modern perspective. The history of separation physics itself is then traced back to the theory of centrifugal force by Huygens and the equivalence of this force to that of gravity. The barometric equation giving the variation of atmospheric pressure with height and the law of partial pressures can then be adapted to the centrifuge to give the steady-state theory of separation. This work was completed in the last century but was not confirmed in its application to isotope separation until 1936. The detailed separation physics for non-steady-state conditions required for a production centrifuge was developed during the American wartime Manhattan Project. During this work the theory giving the maximum output of a centrifuge was developed by Dirac, and soon afterwards Cohen and Kaplan showed that the best method of operation for a production centrifuge is in a countercurrent mode of operation. This method gives a large separation factor at relatively small flow rates through the rotor. The theory of how to set up an internal countercurrent was given by Martin during an equivalent wartime German project, and refinements to the theory, showing how the countercurrent persists along a centrifuge rotor, was given by Dirac and Steenbeck, the latter during a postwar Russian project. This theory was extended by Parker, Ging, and Mayo of the University of Virginia, whose work was completed by 1962, the limit of this review.},

abstract = {A new evaluation has been prepared of the independent {\&} cumulative yields of the products of fission induced by thermal, fast, and 14 MeV neutrons in nuclides important for reactor design and operation and for fuel and waste management. Three spontaneously fissioning nuclides were also considered. The evaluation used a database that is considered to be complete up to early 1989. Careful study was made of experimental uncertainties and discrepancies, emphasizing the need for further measurements. Gaps in the data were filled by interpolation and extrapolation, using fits to empirical models. The yields were subsequently adjusted to fit physical constraints of the fissioning process. This paper describes the methods used in the evaluation, and includes graphs that illustrate the quality of the data. A computer library has been produced in ENDF/B-VI format giving yields from the neutron-induced fission of: Th-232, U-233, U-234, U-235, U-236, U-238, Np-237, Np-238, Pu-238, Pu-239, Pu-240, Pu-241, Pu-242, Am-241, Am-242m, Am-243, and Cm-243, Cm-244, Cm-245, and from the spontaneous fission of Cm-242, Cm-244 and Cf-252.

abstract = {The liquid-drop model has its origins in the first mainstream model of the binding energy of nuclei, sometimes referred to as the semiempirical mass formula, which emerged in the mid 1930s. It is a beautiful example of a model that fulfills the criteria of what a theoretical model is and what an arbitrary parameterization of some data set is not: (1) it has a simple intuitive interpretation, (2) it was of enormous and immediate practical utility in interpreting nuclear experimental data such as radioactive decay and nuclear reactions, (3) it could predict binding energies of nuclei to which its parameters had not been adjusted, (4) it could be generalized to describe new, unanticipated phenomena such as fission, and (5) deviations of its predictions from experimental data yielded insight into nuclear structure and guided the development of more sophisticated models. Generalized liquid-drop models remain important because of the development of macroscopic-microscopic models which give important quantitative insight into ground-state structure and binding energies (nuclear masses) and many details of nuclear fission. We review these points and some associated historical milestones. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The assessment includes i) reviewing past recovery experience and lessons learned; ii) identifying factors that determine recovery; and iii) establishing a contemporary evaluation of U endowments in phosphate rock reserves, as well as the available and recoverable amounts from phosphate rock and phosphoric acid production. We find that in the past, recovery did not fulfill its potential and that the breakup of the Soviet Union worsened then-favorable recovery market conditions in the 1990s. We find that an estimated 5.7 million tU may be recoverable from phosphate rock reserves. In 2010, the recoverable tU from phosphate rock and phosphoric acid production may have been 15,000 tU and 11,000 tU, respectively. This could have filled the world U supply-demand gap for nuclear energy production. The results suggest that the U.S., Morocco, Tunisia, and Russia would be particularly well-suited to recover U, taking infrastructural considerations into account. We demonstrate future research needs, as well as sustainability orientations. We conclude that in order to promote investment and production, it seems necessary to establish long-term contracts at guaranteed prices, ensuring profitability for phosphoric acid producers.},

By embedding the genetic operators in standard CS, the balance between the exploration and exploitation ability further improved and more search space are observed during the algorithms' performance. The computational results carried out on four classical reliability-redundancy allocation problems taken from the literature confirm the validity of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results are presented and compared with the best known solutions. The comparison results with other evolutionary optimization methods demonstrate that the proposed CS-GA algorithm proves to be extremely effective and efficient at locating optimal solutions. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Wolpert1997,
abstract = {A framework is developed to explore the connection between effective optimization algorithms and the problems they are solving. A number of {\&}ldquo;no free lunch{\&}rdquo; (NFL) theorems are presented which establish that for any algorithm, any elevated performance over one class of problems is offset by performance over another class. These theorems result in a geometric interpretation of what it means for an algorithm to be well suited to an optimization problem. Applications of the NFL theorems to information-theoretic aspects of optimization and benchmark measures of performance are also presented. Other issues addressed include time-varying optimization problems and a priori {\&}ldquo;head-to-head{\&}rdquo; minimax distinctions between optimization algorithms, distinctions that result despite the NFL theorems' enforcing of a type of uniformity over all algorithms},

@article{Audet2006,
abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of minimization of a nonsmooth function under general nonsmooth constraints when no derivatives of the objective or constraint functions are avail- able. We introduce the mesh adaptive direct search (MADS) class of algorithms which extends the generalized pattern search (GPS) class by allowing local exploration, called polling, in an asymptot- ically dense set of directions in the space of optimization variables. This means that under certain hypotheses, including a weak constraint qualification due to Rockafellar, MADS can treat constraints by the extreme barrier approach of setting the objective to infinity for infeasible points and treating the problem as unconstrained. The main GPS convergence result is to identify limit points ˆ x, where the Clarke generalized derivatives are nonnegative in a finite set of directions, called refining directions. Although in the unconstrained case, nonnegative combinations of these directions span the whole space, the fact that there can only be finitely many GPS refining directions limits rigorous justification of the barrier approach to finitely many linear constraints for GPS. The main result of this paper is that the general MADS framework is flexible enough to allow the generation of an asymptotically dense set of refining directions along which the Clarke derivatives are nonnegative. We propose an instance of MADS for which the refining directions are dense in the hypertangent cone at ˆ x with probability 1 whenever the iterates associated with the refining directions converge to a single ˆ x. The instance of MADS is compared to versions of GPS on some test problems. We also illustrate the limitation of our results with examples.},

This 24th edition of the ?Red Book?, a recognised world reference on uranium jointly prepared by the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Atomic Energy Agency, provides analyses and information from 42 producing and consuming countries in order to address these and other questions. It offers a comprehensive review of world uranium supply and demand as well as data on global uranium exploration, resources, production and reactor-related requirements. It also provides substantive new information on established uranium production centres around the world and in countries developing production centres for the first time. Projections of nuclear generating capacity and reactor-related requirements through 2035, incorporating policy changes following the Fukushima accident, are also featured, along with an analysis of long-term uranium supply and demand issues.},

@article{Mukherjee2004,
abstract = {The thresholds of (n,xn) reactions in various activation detectors are commonly used to unfold the neutron spectra covering a broad energy span, i.e. from thermal to several hundreds of MeV. The saturation activities of the daughter nuclides (i.e. reaction products) serve as the input data of specific spectra unfolding codes, such as SAND-II and LOUHI-83. However, most spectra unfolding codes, including the above, require an a priori (guess) spectrum to starting up the unfolding procedure of an unknown spectrum. The accuracy and exactness of the resulting spectrum primarily depends on the subjectively chosen guess spectrum. On the other hand, the Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based spectra unfolding technique ANDI-03 (Activation-detector Neutron DIfferentiation) presented in this report does not require a specific starting parameter. The GA is a robust problem-solving tool, which emulates the Darwinian Theory of Evolution prevailing in the realm of biological world and is ideally suited to optimise complex objective functions globally in a large multidimensional solution space. The activation data of the 27Al(n,alpha)24Na, 116In(n,gamma)116mIn, 12C(n,2n)11C and 209Bi(n,xn)(210-x)Bi reactions recorded at the high-energy neutron field of the ISIS Spallation source (Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK) was obtained from literature and by applying the ANDI-03 GA tool, these data were used to unfold the neutron spectra. The total neutron fluence derived from the neutron spectrum unfolded using GA technique (ANDI-03) agreed within +/-6.9{\%} (at shield top level) and +/-27.2{\%} (behind a 60 cm thick concrete shield) with the same unfolded with the SAND-II code.},

abstract = {High-power spallation neutron sources offer a unique opportunity to gather critical measurements on the very early transient displacement damage in semiconductors. This paper discusses the important attributes of spallation neutron facilities used for investigating the transient radiation hardness of semiconductors. By comparing the attributes of some different types of radiation facilities currently used for semiconductor damage characterization, a new and important role for spallation neutron sources is identified. Comparisons are made between the attributes of the spallation neutron source and fast-burst reactors, water-moderated reactors, ion microbeams, and electron accelerators. By incorporating electromagnetic shielding, photocurrent shunts and new experimental techniques, testing at spallation neutron sources has permitted the earliest measurements of transient gain to be lowered from the previous time of 250 ??s, achieved at fast-burst reactors, to 8 ??s. This is over a factor of 30 improvement in the test capability. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Whitley1984a,
abstract = {There are two sets of principles involved in the development of the gas centrifuge, the internal separation physics and the external means of spinning a rotor at very high speeds. Only the first aspect is discussed in this part of the review. First, the industrial requirement for the separation of the uranium isotopes is defined so that the separation history can be put in a modern perspective. The history of separation physics itself is then traced back to the theory of centrifugal force by Huygens and the equivalence of this force to that of gravity. The barometric equation giving the variation of atmospheric pressure with height and the law of partial pressures can then be adapted to the centrifuge to give the steady-state theory of separation. This work was completed in the last century but was not confirmed in its application to isotope separation until 1936. The detailed separation physics for non-steady-state conditions required for a production centrifuge was developed during the American wartime Manhattan Project. During this work the theory giving the maximum output of a centrifuge was developed by Dirac, and soon afterwards Cohen and Kaplan showed that the best method of operation for a production centrifuge is in a countercurrent mode of operation. This method gives a large separation factor at relatively small flow rates through the rotor. The theory of how to set up an internal countercurrent was given by Martin during an equivalent wartime German project, and refinements to the theory, showing how the countercurrent persists along a centrifuge rotor, was given by Dirac and Steenbeck, the latter during a postwar Russian project. This theory was extended by Parker, Ging, and Mayo of the University of Virginia, whose work was completed by 1962, the limit of this review.},

abstract = {In the wake of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident, questions are being raised about the future of the uranium market, including as regards the number of reactors expected to be built in the coming years, the amount of uranium required to meet forward demand, the adequacy of identified uranium resources to meet that demand and the ability of the sector to meet reactor requirements in a challenging investment climate. This 24th edition of the ?Red Book?, a recognised world reference on uranium jointly prepared by the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Atomic Energy Agency, provides analyses and information from 42 producing and consuming countries in order to address these and other questions. It offers a comprehensive review of world uranium supply and demand as well as data on global uranium exploration, resources, production and reactor-related requirements. It also provides substantive new information on established uranium production centres around the world and in countries developing production centres for the first time. Projections of nuclear generating capacity and reactor-related requirements through 2035, incorporating policy changes following the Fukushima accident, are also featured, along with an analysis of long-term uranium supply and demand issues.},
