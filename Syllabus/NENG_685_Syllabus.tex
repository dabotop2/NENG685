\section*{Course Description}

This course covers the principal methods used for deterministically solving the Boltzmann transport equation for neutral particles (neutrons and photons). This course presents the fundamental mathematical and computational methods using discretizations in space, energy, and angle.  Iterative methods for efficient solution of the transport problems are explored and analyzed.  Monte Carlo and Discrete Ordinates methods are explicitly developed and applied to shielding and criticality problems of interest.  The course will include both code development and use of existing codes for solving criticality and shielding problems of interest in nuclear engineering.

\section*{Course Objectives}

At the end of the course, students should:
\begin{itemize}
\item Understand program design, structure, and procedures
\item Develop code to solve problems of interest in nuclear engineering
\item Be able to numerically solve ODEs, PDEs, and systems of equations
\item Be able to perform numerical integration and differentiation
\item Understand the different methods of neutron transport and their associated benefits and drawbacks
\item Understand Boltzmann Transport Equation, Diffusion Equation, and the methods used to solve them
\item Understand Monte Carlo transport techniques and associated concepts
\item Be familiar with deterministic transport (PENTRAN) and stochastic transport (MCNP) codes
\item Be comfortable operating in the remote high performance computing environments available at AFIT
\end{itemize}

\section*{Grading}

Grading will consist of a variety of metrics: homeworks, "pre-flight" quizzes, and a final project. 
The grading structure reflects that programming and algorithm development can only be achieved through practice. 
The pre-flight quizzes are meant to enhance learning by instilling key foundational ideas prior to use in class.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Homework: 45\%\footnote{Late submissions: -20\% for each day it is late with a maximum of -60\%.}
  \item Pre-flight Quizzes: 25\%\footnote{Pre-flight quizzes are based on the assigned reading/material, and are due by 2359 the day before the class they are due.}
  \item Final Project (code, paper, presentation): 30\% 
\end{itemize}

It is not anticipated that there will be a curve applied.  It is my belief that the grades will sort themselves out if the course assessment material is properly done.  I have no set distribution of grades and have no reservation about everyone earning \enquote{As} or any other grade on the spectrum.  Rarely are there enough statistics (i.e. students) in this class to try to impose a normal distribution on the grades and in the AF (and grad school) 90\% of the people are above average. \newline

Extra points - specified in each assignment - may be available for following "best practices" that are above and beyond what is required to complete the assignment.

\section*{Programming Language}

My philosophy is that it is best to know one language really well because different organizations, communities, projects, etc. will require different languages, and it is impossible and often counterproductive to learn them all.  If you know one language well, you can pick up other languages when the need arises. \newline

Consistent with this philosophy, this course will primarily be taught using Python. The goal is to get you proficient in \textit{a language} by the end of the course. However, you are free to use whatever language you feel comfortable with and works for your workflow.  The languages I will be able to help with in order of decreasing knowledge and/or increasing time since last use: Python, Matlab, FORTRAN, C++, and Java.  There are other resources in the department, online, and in my library for the various languages as well that you are free to use.

\section*{Academic Integrity}

Academic Integrity - "Uncompromising adherence to a code of ethics, morality, conduct, scholarship, and other values related to academic activity." (AUI 36-2309) \newline

Academic Freedom - "Academic freedom must be tempered by good judgment to refrain from making offensive remarks, unfounded opinions, or irresponsible statements." (AUI 36-2308) \newline

Non-Attribution - "All guest speakers, students, and permanent-party personnel are prohibited from divulging the identity of any particular speaker, whether a guest speaker, faculty member, or student, for the purpose of attributing to that speaker any specific remarks or statements, including but not limited to offensive remarks and irresponsible statements." (AUI 36-2308) \newline

AFIT provides detailed guidance about these policies in the Student Handbook. Lack of knowledge of these policies is not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to me. \newline

There are also several great publications on your responsibilities as a scientist/engineer and researcher.  I'd recommend at least skimming:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The National Academies Press's \href{https://www.nap.edu/catalog/12192/on-being-a-scientist-a-guide-to-responsible-conduct-in}{"On Being a Scientist"} 
  \item The National Academy of Sciences's \href{https://www.nap.edu/catalog/21896/fostering-integrity-in-research}{"Fostering Integrity in Research"}
\end{itemize}

My policy is that you may work together on homework, but you must \textbf{specifically cite with whom you worked and what you did together}.

\section*{Attendance}

Course credit presumes the student has attended all class sessions in addition to completing all tasks.  Thus, attendance is mandatory in all sessions to graduate.  If students have an extraordinary reason to be absent (example: a sickness, car breakdown, etc.), the student must contact the instructor (in advance if possible) to evaluate if the absence will be excusable.
