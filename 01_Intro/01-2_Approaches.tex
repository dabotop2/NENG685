We've talked about the problem types that we can be faced with as nuclear engineers in the arena of national security. Now let's talk about approaches and what kinds of methods we use when. 

%-------------------------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Computational Methods}
Inside the box of computational methods, we have two main categories: 
\begin{compactitem}
\item \textbf{Deterministic}: discretize all independent variables, obtain a set of coupled, linear, algebraic equations and develop a numerical method to solve them.
\item \textbf{Probabilistic}: follow the history of each relevant particle based on the underlying probabilities for various types of interactions.
\end{compactitem}
%
Each method has its own benefits and challenges. We'll talk a bit about \textbf{deterministic first}. Here, the discretization methods are a big part of the strategy, followed by parallelization.

The size of the problems (which impacts memory and parallelization performance) is governed by discretization. The quality and behavior of solutions is also governed by discretization. To get more accurate fluxes, typical transport problems today are three-dimensional, have up to thousands $\times$ thousands $\times$ thousands of mesh points, use up to $\sim$150 energy groups, include accurate expansions of scattering terms, and are solved over many directions.

\begin{table}[!h]
\caption{Meaning and Range of Indices Used in Transport Discretization}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c}
\hline
Variable & Symbol & First & Last & Low & High \\[0.5ex]
\hline
Energy & g & 1 & G & 2 & 100s \\
Solid Angle & a & 1 & n & $S_2$ & $S_{16}$ \\
Space & n/a & n/a & n/a & 1? & 1e9 \\
Legendre moment ($P_{N}$) & $l$ & 0 & N & 0 & 9 \\
%Spherical harmonic moment ($Y$) & m & 0 & $l$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{table:index}
\end{table}

E.g.\ In 2012, a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR)-900 with 44 groups, a 578 $\times$ 578 $\times$ 700 mesh, using $S_{16}$ level-symmetric quadrature, and with $P_{0}$ scattering was solved: 1.7 trillion unknowns.

With \textbf{Monte Carlo}, we sample the physics of every single interaction of every single particle until we have enough samples to assert that something is statistically valid. This requires lots and lots of samples, but is typically fairly easy to parallelize. Monte Carlo requires strategies and rules for sampling the physics--which can be complicated.

\subsubsection*{Diffusion Equation}
In this class we won't actually do much with the full BTE.  Instead, we will use the diffusion equation, which simplifies the math a bit.
The diffusion equation removes the angle dependence and gives only $\phi$ as a solution. Nuclear reactions and thus interaction rates only depend on the scalar flux, so maybe that's sufficient.

The diffusion equation is derived by starting with the transport equation and \textbf{integrating over all angles}. In the derivation we make the following assumptions
\begin{compactitem}
\item the scattering term is azimuthally symmetric
\item assume that scattering is at most linearly anisotropic [$P_1$ expansion]
\item assume that the angular flux is at most linearly anisotropic [expand $\psi$ in Legendre polynomials out to $P_1$]
\end{compactitem} 

We will work through this derivation in the coming weeks.

This equation \textit{now includes several assumptions} that are \textbf{valid} when the solution is \textbf{not} near
%
\begin{compactitem}
\item a void, 
\item boundary, 
\item source, 
\item or strong absorber.
\end{compactitem} 
%
While these requirements can be quite restrictive, the diffusion equation has been used frequently for analysis of nuclear systems throughout the history of the nuclear industry.

\subsection*{Comparison}
In order of increasing accuracy\textit{ and} increasing runtime: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Diffusion Theory
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item discretized and homogenized space
  \item linearly anisotropic direction
  \item discretized energy (few-group)
  \end{compactitem}
\item Deterministic
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item discretized space
  \item discretized direction (discrete ordinates [$S_N$]) or 
        functional expansion of direction (spherical harmonics)
  \item discretized energy (multi-group)
  \end{compactitem}
\item Monte Carlo
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item continuous spatial resolution
  \item continuous direction representation
  \item continuous energy representation
  \end{compactitem}
\end{enumerate}

We tend to think of Monte Carlo as ``benchmark quality" and highly flexible. \\
What is one major hazard of Monte Carlo?\\
What is the biggest challenge of using MC for detailed design?
